Node js is event driven and non blocking I/O model which means multiple operations can be done
where every one is happening simultaneously.

I/O operation is when any operation is done where fetching of users from DB
or hitting some some server to get response back from it.

NOn blocking does not make the I/O operation run faster but it does not wait
for it , it does othere job while waiting.

Its single thread with non blocking nature.
